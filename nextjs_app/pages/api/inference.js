Here is the code for the file `nextjs_app/pages/api/inference.js`:

```javascript
import { query } from "../../api/inference";

export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const data = req.body;
  import { query } from "../../api/inference/[id]";
  res.status(200).json(response);
}
```

const response = await query(data);

This code imports the `query` function from the file `nextjs_app/pages/api/inference/[id].js`. It defines an asynchronous request handler function that receives a request (`req`) and a response (`res`) object. Inside the handler function, it extracts the request body (`data`) and calls the `query` function with the data. The response from the `query` function is then sent back as a JSON response with a status code of 200.
