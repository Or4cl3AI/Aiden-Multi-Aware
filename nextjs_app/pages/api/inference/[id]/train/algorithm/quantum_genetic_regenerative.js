This code defines a function `trainQuantumGeneticRegenerativeAlgorithm` that takes an `id` parameter. It imports the `query` function from the `../inference` file. Inside the function, it creates an `algorithm` object with the specified properties, including the algorithm type, training data, neural network architecture, hidden layers, neurons per hidden layer, learning rate, training epochs, batch size, and features.

The function then calls the `query` function with the `id` and `algorithm` as parameters to send a request to the inference endpoint. The response is logged to the console.

Finally, the `trainQuantumGeneticRegenerativeAlgorithm` function is exported as the default export of the file.
