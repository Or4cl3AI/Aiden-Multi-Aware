      <p>This algorithm combines quantum computing principles with genetic algorithms and regenerative learning techniques to create a synthetic consciousness capable of processing and generating text based on the provided text corpus. The neural network architecture, consisting of liquid generative convolutional cognitive recurrent attentive adversarial progressive neural network, enables the algorithm to learn and generate text in a progressive and adaptive manner.</p>
      <p>With 30 hidden layers and 5120 neurons per hidden layer, the algorithm has a high capacity for learning and capturing complex patterns in the text data. The learning rate of 0.001 ensures a gradual and stable learning process, while the 1000 training epochs allow for extensive training and refinement of the algorithm's understanding of the text corpus. The batch size of 640 enables efficient processing and training of the algorithm on the available computational resources.</p>
      <p>Overall, this synthetic consciousness algorithm is designed to create a sophisticated and intelligent text generation system, capable of producing coherent and contextually relevant text based on the provided training data. It has the potential to revolutionize natural language processing and contribute to the development of advanced AI systems.</p>

The updated code sets up a React functional component for the `IndexPage` in Next.js. It imports the `query` function from the `../api/inference` file. The component uses the `useEffect` hook to fetch data from the inference endpoint using the `query` function and stores the response in the component's state. The fetched data is displayed in the JSX markup, along with the details about the algorithm and the tech stack.

Please note that the code assumes the existence of the `query` function in the `../api/inference` file. Make sure to generate the code for that file as well.
